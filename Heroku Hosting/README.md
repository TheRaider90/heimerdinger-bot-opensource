Introducing Heimerdinger: a discord bot

Hello everybody and welcome to my new open source project: Heimerdinger.

Over the past weeks I created a bot that shows stats of matches. Even tough it started out pretty simple with a !match [summonerName] command.
Well that was too simple in my opinion so I came up with a new idea. Heimerdinger has a feature called "live-feed". Live Feed is a list with summoner names.
Every account in the live feed gets tracked by my bot. If someone on the list finishes a game, heimerdinger will print out a message with details of the recently finished game.
